    How can we achieve Abstraction

    1)Abstract class(0 t0 100)
    2)Interface(100% abstraction)

    even if we have one method as abstract then the class should be abstract class

    abstract class can have implementation method also

    A class can be declared abstract even it doesn't have any abstract method

    we cant create an object for abstract class

    if a child does not implement all abstract method then the child class should
    be declared as abstract class


    encapsulation process of binding data and method together

    what is the need of an interface when an abstraction can be achieved through abstract class?

    interface is not only about abstraction
     functionality we are creating will be useful across a wide range of objects then we prefer to use interface

     interface is more flexible than abstract class we can extends only one abstract class
     but implements multiple interface
